Ratskeller story:
I was listening to musik at the Ratskerller whilst eating a bratwurst.
A server wearing dirndel came to my table to drop off a brot and another drink.
I then left in my BMW to Berlin.
From Berlin, I headed to the Flughafen to catch a flight.
I knew my flight had a long layover in Raesfeld, and my lederhose would be too uncomfortable for the long trip, so I decided to change. clothes.  
While changing clothes I noticed that the klimaanlage was not working very well.
So I unlocked the Schloss on the door to let some air in.
Then, I proceeded to to eat a Brot.
While eating, I imagined walking through a Biergarten.
Afterward, I fell asleep while listening to Rammstein.
