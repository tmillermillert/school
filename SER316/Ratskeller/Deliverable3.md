# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Bus scheduling

**Sprint Number:** 3

**Scrum Master**: Jaehoon Cho

**Git Master**: Adam Clifton  

### Sprint Planning
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** 
> For this sprint, we want to integrate our data structure features within the bus sheduler app.  We would like to attain full functionality with only the visualization possibly left out. 

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  
> 9

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> 5

**How many User Stories did you add?**

> 4

**Why did you add exactly these US?**

> We added user stories to integrate all of the data structure features from our previous sprint to make our system unified. 

**Why do you think you will get them done?**

> These features should deal more with UI implementation and making sure the user experience is functional and adequate. 

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, we will need integrate our feature added from Sprint 2, test and ensure the features are functional.  


## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies weekly, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes (Daily Scrum):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that)

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

**Screen Cast link**: Your link

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> The value we created for this sprint was to resolve some back end issues for storage and to start developing the UI.  The majority of the sprint involved adding features to the UI; we had some issues arise that led to incomplete feature sets, but the framework are present and functional. 

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> We ran into some issues getting the database storage system to work and had some other problems arise mapping information to the UI.  However, we took on all of our remaining sprint goals for this final sprint and managed to work through a majority of them.  We think this fulfills the expectations of the sprint. 

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> Based on the number of setbacks we had during this sprint, We do not believe the customer would be satisfied with the present product.  The reason for this is many of our features are partially implemented.  We think the customer would be pleased to see tangible progress being made on the software, albeit not in a fully implemented state.

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> No, we did not meet our sprint goal. We tried to achieve full functionality and visualization of routes, but only managed to partially implement each. 

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> we had 9 user stories and managed to complete 6 user stories. Given the overall work involved, we believe we made decent progress. 

**If not, what went wrong?**

> As mentioned above, we took on all of our user stories left in our backlog, which amounted to 33.5 points.  We managed to complete 19 points during this sprint, leaving 11 partially or fully incomplete.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> Judging by our burndown chart, we did the majority of our work on December 4-6.  In context, there was a major holiday during this sprint and many of us were unable to work on the project during that time.  

**Did you deliver business value?**

> We believe we created some business value in establishing some UI features and cleaning up the back end code.  We were not able to bring as much of a product as we would have liked at the end of this sprint due to setbacks mentioned earlier.  

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> If there were another sprint, we could communicate more effectively, fix technical issues with development tools, neo4j specifically, and work more consistently during the next sprint. Obviously, we should not be doing the majority of our work in the last few days as we did this sprint.   

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> This sprint revolved around our team implementing some of the tougher UI features and mapping them to our data structures.  This was a consistent point of struggle throughout this sprint, and led to many partially implemented features. We believe we would be able to fully implement if we had more time, but we no longer have that luxury.
