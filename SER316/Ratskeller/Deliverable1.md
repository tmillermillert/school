# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Bus scheduling

**Sprint Number:** 1

**Scrum Master**: Adam Clifton

**Git Master**: Angie Cojom

### Sprint Planning
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** 
> Finish all US that we committed to. Work on the project throughout the week instead of all at once.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  
> 2

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> 8

**How many User Stories did you add?**

> 3

**Why did you add exactly these US?**

> Acceptance criteria and subtask

**Why do you think you will get them done?**

> A lot of them are just removing unnecessary functionality and locating the souce code to make a simple change.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes start the sprint.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies weekly, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes (Daily Scrum):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that)

| Date     | Attendees  |Minutes   | Burndown Info | TravisCI info | Additional Info                  |
|10/23/19  | Everyone   |6:00pm-8:30pm       | NA            | NA            | Team Exercise and Quality policy |
|10/24/19  | Everyone   |6:00pm-8:30pm       | NA            | NA            | Sprint Planning |

### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings they attended:

Marcus Miller : 4

Brayden Giffen : 4

Jaehoon Cho : 4

Adam Clifton : 4

Angie Cojom : 4


## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

**Screen Cast link**: https://youtu.be/e51_W6CP0NY

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> The value we created for this sprint is we laid a good foundation for future changes to the software.  We spent the majority of the sprint fixing bugs, removing unnecessary features and cleaning up the ui to better suit bus scheduling software.  

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> We completed our sprint goals and believe we set ourselves up to better implement important features in upcoming sprints.  We think this fulfills the expectations of the first sprint.  

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> Yes, as mentioned above, we fixed many bugs and UI issues in the software and began refactoring the software to be used for bus scheduling.  The running software is in a noticeably better state than when it was first received.  

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes, we met our sprint goal and completed all eight of our User Stories.  

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> We had two user stories left on the backlog, mainly because we needed more information before we could begin working on them. 

**If not, what went wrong?**

> Please see answer above. 

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> Yes, we working at a fairly consistent speed throughout the sprint.  Many of our user stories were completed before the deadline.  The final day was more chaotic than it needed to be while doing final merges before adding to master, but now gives us room for improvement on future sprints. 

**Did you deliver business value?**

> We believe we delivered business value.  The software was very buggy when received, and is now is a much better state than it was.  We fixed many of the functionality hindering bugs and began the transition of the software to the new bus scheduling implementation.  The owner should be able to see noticeable changes and step in the correct direction based on their specification.  

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> We can communicate more effectively, fix technical issues with development tools, and work more consistently during the next sprint.   

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

>This sprint revolved around bug fixes of the software, so we are optimistic that we laid a strong foundation for the rest of the implementations that we will do.  The deeper substantive changes will be seen in the upcoming sprint when the Bus Scheduler should truly begin to take shape.
