# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Bus scheduling

**Sprint Number:** 2

**Scrum Master**: Marcus Miller

**Git Master**: Brayden Giffen

### Sprint Planning
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** 
> For this sprint, we want to implement the foundational data structures for the software, which we will build our enhancements from the structure.  

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  
> 12

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> 4

**How many User Stories did you add?**

> 10

**Why did you add exactly these US?**

> We added user stories to implement data structures and important logic functions to the system. 

**Why do you think you will get them done?**

> A lot of the team has done similar programming tasks, we feel comfortable implementing data structures, and it is important to lay the sotrage and logic foundation for the system.  

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, we will need reasearch and accomplish our user stories,  research JSON and Neo4j to finish the implementation.  



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies weekly, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes (Daily Scrum):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that)

| **Date** | **Attendees** | **Minutes** | **Burndown Info** | **Travis CI** | **Additional Info** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11/06/2019 | Everyone | 21:00-22:00 |   | NA | Team Exercise and Quality policy |
| 11/10/2019 | Everyone | 13:00-14:00 |   | NA | Sprint Planning |
| 11/12/2019 | Everyone | 16:30-16:45 |   | NA | Standup |
| 11/14/2019 | Everyone | 20:45-21:20 |   | NA | Standup |
| 11/16/2019 | Everyone | 13:30-14:30 |   | NA | Standup |
| 11/17/2019 | Everyone | 21:00-22:30 |   | Passed | Finalization of Sprint |

### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings they attended:

Marcus Miller : 6

Brayden Giffen : 6

Jaehoon Cho : 6

Adam Clifton : 6

Angie Cojom : 6


## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

**Screen Cast link**: https://youtu.be/3IGf464KFxk 

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> The value we created for this sprint is we prepared most of the internal workings for the bus node and route system.  Visually, not much has changed with the software.  This will be handled in the next sprint.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> We completed our sprint goals, prepped most of the data structure and logic behind the software.  We think this fulfills the expectations of our Sprint 2, and will hopefully prep us sufficiently for the final sprint.  

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> Yes, as mentioned above, we prepared internal workings of the program and do not have a good visual representation of the software to reflect our work.  A customer may frown upon this.  However, we believe this was a necessary step before implementing our features into the UI more effectively.  

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> We have some tasks left from US49, and according to Taiga IO, we have 7 points not completed.  However, looking at the actual Sprint board, we have one US not completed and that US encompasses 2 points.  

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> We had eight user stories left on the backlog.  Many revolve around UI changes and hopefully will be able to implement without too many drawbacks.  We decided to use Neo4j graphing database to handle the visualization, nodes and routing for this software.  We took steps to implement and Sprint 2, and four of the eight US in the backlog tie in to implementation of this software. 

**If not, what went wrong?**

> Neo4j didn't have a API with graphics which we thought it did. 

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> According to Taiga, our work was fairly consistent, but not enough work was being done.  As mentioned above, the board says we have 7 points left to complete for the Sprint, but only have one US that was incomplete worth a total of 2 points.  We are unsure how Taiga is calculating the difference. 

**Did you deliver business value?**

> We believe we delivered business value.  The underlying data structure and system will vital and necessary for the project moving forward.  Although, it has not changed much visually, we believe the software will is in a much better state. 

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> We can communicate more effectively, fix technical issues with development tools, test our build more effectively, and work more consistently during the last sprint.   

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> This sprint revolved data structure implementation.  We left many US in the backlog to be completed in the final Sprint.  We have our work cut out for us.

  **What was your main contribution to the Quality Policy documentation?:

    - We had some problems with people creating a pull request and then their CI tests failing after the merge, and then the group was not able to get ahold of them to get them to fix their problems. This left it to the rest of the group to figure out. I suggested that we add to the Quality Policy that you must wait and make sure your CI tests pass for your merge before going offline.
